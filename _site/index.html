<p>I cannot even remember the first time I had a server at home. I believe it was during the first year at the University of Edinburgh, maybe ?</p>

<p>I remember the hardware though, it was my old Hewlett-Packard Bell laptop. Which oddly enough, I still have around to this day.</p>

<p>Alright, my current hardware:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Raspberry pi 2</li>
  <li>Desktop PC with dual monitors</li>
  <li>Nvidia shield TV connected to the TV</li>
  <li>Steam Link connected to the tv</li>

This HDD is a carryover from my life in the uk therefore it has a powerbrick with UK plug, so I have a travel adaptor connected to it. This irritates me greatly and cannot wait to get rid of it.</p>

<p>The raspberry pi is connected directly to my router via a short cat5 cable. Absolute standard Arch install, and no modifications to pacman whatsoever.</p>

<p>List of installed packages: <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/markitoxs/a2c6941b3a05eedab22698891df11bd1/raw/83659f6a0dc6dcb9f2df344e77fc09065869ee7/installed_packages">Packages</a></p>

<p>Probably the only ones worth noticing are <strong>rtorrent</strong>,<strong>samba</strong>, <strong>screen</strong>, <strong>sickrage2-git</strong> (this one installed from the AUR).</p>

<p>The raspberry pi acts as a file server, sharing the hard drive contents ( Yes, I am aware of the public, and 0777 mask):</p>

<h2 id="rtorrent-096">rTorrent (0.9.6)</h2>
<p>Alright, here is my <code class="highlighter-rouge">.rtorrent.rc</code></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[root@montecarlo ~]# cat .rtorrent.rc

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The important things to note are:
- enabling scgi + log file
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">
  scgi_port = :5000
  log.xmlrpc  = /tmp/log/xmlrpc.log
 </code>
- The move of stuff into a complete folder:
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">
  #TVSHOWS LABEL
  # Add new method to get finished dir
  system.method.insert = d.get_finished_dir,simple,"cat=/mnt/tera/complete/,$d.get_custom1="
 </code>
- The usage of that move method:
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">
  system.method.set_key = event.download.finished,move_complete,"d.set_directory=$d.get_finished_dir=;execute=mkdir,-p,$d.get_finished_dir=;execute=mv,-u,$d.get_base_path=,$d.get_finished_dir="
 </code></p>

<p>Then go ahead and create a systemd unit file to start rTorrent on boot:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[root@montecarlo ~]# cat /etc/systemd/system/default.target.wants/rt.service
[Unit]
Description=rTorrent
After=network.target

[Service]

ExecStop=/usr/bin/killall -w -s 2 /usr/bin/rtorrent
WorkingDirectory=%h
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And enable it with: <code class="highlighter-rouge">systemctl enable rt</code></p>

<h2 id="sickrage">SickRage</h2>

<p>Sickrage is my download manager choice. I am calling it a download manager becuase I am not sure what to call it. It basically keeps a database with the shows we follow and looks for the episodes as they come out. I installed the package off the AUR: <code class="highlighter-rouge">yaourt sickrage2-git</code> which allows you to start it off via a systemd unit:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">
[root@montecarlo ~]# systemctl list-units | grep sickrage  
sickrage.service                  loaded active running   SickRage Daemon
</code></p>

<p>Here comes the complicated part, so please stay with me on this one.</p>

<p>Go to general config and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The root directory for sickrage will be at <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mnt/tera/Video/tvshows</code></li>
  <li>Generate an API key (for use later)</li>
</ul>

<p>Go to Search Settings / Torrent search:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enable torrent search providers</li>
  <li>Send .rtorrent files to: <code class="highlighter-rouge">rTorrent</code></li>
  <li>Torrent host:port    <code class="highlighter-rouge">scgi://localhost:5000</code></li>
  <li>Http Authentication:  <code class="highlighter-rouge">None</code></li>
  <li>Add label to torrent: <code class="highlighter-rouge">tvshows</code></li>
  <li>Downloaded files location: <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mnt/tera/complete</code></li>
</ul>

<p>(Note that the scgi details and the location matches with our previous rtorrent config.)</p>

<p>You can verify the scgi connection by hitting ** Test Connection**</p>

<p>Go to Post Processing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enable</li>
  <li>Post Processing Dir: <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mnt/tera/complete/tvshows</code></li>
  <li>Processing Method: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Symbolic Link</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I choose Symbolic link to prevent issues with rtorrent seeding. Sickrage might move the file before the upload ratio is met, and leave you with an orphaned file.</p>

<p>Go to Notifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enable notifying kodi (you will need to setup kodi to allow remote calls)</li>
</ul>

<p>Got to Shows/Add Shows/Add New Show</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find the show</li>
  <li>Select Parent folder as: <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mnt/tera/Videos/tvshows</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Dont forget to enable the service with: <code class="highlighter-rouge">systemctl enable sickrage</code></p>
 </p>
      </li>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2016/06/17/rebase.html">Rebase</a>
          <p> <p>Today was an interesting day. To be more precise, the last 24 hours were, since it all started last night.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be fair to say that in fact it all started a few weeks ago when I started to realize how clueless I have been about everything, and howit is time to finally jump on the ship that will guide me towards the final destination: becoming the ultimate.</p>

<p>Not only orchestration is something that I will need to solve, and figure out the best approach, but monitoring will become a big part of it. There doesnt seem to be that many solutions out there. To be fair, I should say FREE solutions. My guess is that companies quickly realized how big of a market this can be in the world we live in, where continuous deployment is no longer a paradime that exists only in the wettest dreams of some crazy hipster guy.</p>

<p>This is a reality, and it is time to get real.</p>

<p>Get real.</p>

<p>I will follow the trends, and best-practices will be there for a reason, without sacrificing the power of one’s mind. Do not think inside the box, do not think outside the box. Just think. That is my advise to you future-self.</p>

<p>The concept of merge has always been interesting to me. Now I have something new to think about. Does rebase currently make sense in our workflow? I believe so. Time to fight for it.</p>

<p>We will integrate, we will deploy.</p>

          <p> <p>So… need to upload pictures, but in the last week I got the desktop machine up and running based on the standard minimal arch install.</p>

<p>I am running Slim as my login control, openbox as my window manager, lxpanel as a panel, which I quite like because it gives me icons for all virtual desktops, and provides a tray area.</p>

<p>Spudcloud allows me to connect to Slack, Atom has been setup just as I had it before, with unity and molokai themes.</p>

<p>Speaking of themes, I managed to get powerline up and running on my prompt and also in my vim status bar.</p>

<p>This morning got sopcast and acestream running. Both are soooo much better than when I used them ages ago.</p>

<p>BTW, very surprised how good the opensource drivers for my 7970 are. So much better than the proprietary ones. Im calling this one a win.</p>

<p>Will post pictures soon.</p>

          <p> <p>The PSU for my new machine has arrived, and it is an absolute beauty
<img src="http://www.evga.com/products/images/gallery/110-B1-0750-VR_XL_4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I had absolutely no clue that modular power supplies were a thing. This probably tells you how long it has been since I last build a machine.</p>

<p>The pi2, as much as I love the idea, was a no go for my needs. The web has turned into a jungle where a strong processor is required, so why not? Lets get a cheap PC, and go with it. This does not mean I will not continue my pursuit of a cheap low power machine, but will probably delay the answer to my questions, if any.</p>

<p>When it comes to computer cases, they all seem pretty standard. Square boxes. Really, there is not much else asides from that. A very long time ago, I came across some hackintosh computer that was using the bitfenix case, and instantly fell in love with it. I quickly added it to my amazon shopping cart, this was probably lik 16/18 months ago? Until last week, when I finally ordered it.</p>

<p>It arrived last friday. And it turns out that whoever decided the names for the sizes of motherboards was an absolute idiot. To me, as an engineer, it makes virtually, and I have a pretty good imagination, no sense that Micro ITX would be bigger than MINI-ITX, but that is the case. Get it? That is the case.</p>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/VIA_Mini-ITX_Form_Factor_Comparison.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>So I had to go and return to amazon the one I ordered and locate a model compatible with Micro-ITX. Luckily I was able to, but that is a story on its own.</p>

<p>Currently copying the img of archlinux into the usb stick! Will report back.

<p>There’s been minimal surf lately, but I’ve tried to make the best out of it. Having a calendar and crossing days off it doesnt make sense. It’s not about that really.</p>

<p>I was in SanFrancisco and didnt really like it. Felt alienated. I love the pace of life here even if it might seem boring for some people. I can see the ocean every day, and walk alongside the cliffs. Things are starting to fall into place slowly.</p>

<p>We danced while we were cooking dinner.</p>

<p>I just received some rechargeable patteries, they are the eneloop series. Should be good and much better than this energizer rubbish.</p>

<p>Will I be able to be number 8 in the team? Who knows, hopefully I will. Im debating wether to get 14 or 5 as a backup number, perhaps 6.</p>

<p>Also, I’ve come to realize that I no longer care about flagship phones. Sure, they are nice to look at, and perhaps to play with. But there is no point. I think something along the lines of what Motorola is doing with its MotoG and E is much much more interesting in today’s world. Trying to provide a good product at a lower cost is very exciting, and I am surprised more companies don’t attempt what Motorola (or Lenovo) is doing.</p>

<p>Will keep updating. Session timeout.</p>

          <p> <p>Oh man, totally bough a new sd card, and the raspberry pi is now much faster and responsive.</p>

<p>I am still finishing setting up my environment, but it is looking promising.</p>

<p>Will be trying to get Darwin surfing later on. Might be a total fail. Might not.</p>

<p>Snowboarding in 2 days!!!! WOOP WOOP.</p>

          <p> <p>Turns out I was right. My solution to the problem by Joan was right.</p>

<p>Apparently the raspberry pi 2 is powerful enough to be used as a main machine. I’m very skeptical. I have just finished installing arch on the card, and will see if I can get some sort of basic desktop going on. See if it can handle some javascript heavy web browsing.</p>

<p>Also, perhaps I should buy a new micro sd card, the pi seems to take forever for any operation that requires writing to the memory.</p>

<p>Will keep updating.</p>

Random Access Thoughts
===</p>

<p>My chest still hurts. I have no clue whats going.</p>

<p>Just cut my hair. I need to stop doing this by myself.</p>

<p>Dang it still hurts.</p>

<p>Creativity.</p>

<p>Writing.</p>

<p>Reading.</p>

<p>Surfing.</p>

<p>Longerboard. Paddle power.</p>

<p>Snowboarding next week should be fun.</p>

<p>I wish I had a normal machine that I could run linux on it and not have to worry about stupid things like battery life. Perhaps the raspberry pi2 that I just got might be the answer? It might be powerful enough, although it would be awesome to just get a NUC. Could I justify spending that much money for one? They are a bit pricey.</p>

<p>Also, it worries me that a new generation of NUCs comes out after I buy this one, would be like a terrible waste of money.</p>

<p>I really want a coffee with whipped cream and a donut, oh man, that sounds so good. Fuck it, maybe I just get one tomorrow. Why not.</p>

<p>Got two Sonos Play:1 and they are absolutely fantastic, came across someone on reddit who said they shouldnt have tried the stereo setup, because now they want to buy two more. I am in exactly the same situation.</p>

<p>Joan asked me what was a simple question today, about some script, and I failed to deliver an answer that was satisfactory. That bugs me a lot, and I want to know the answer.</p>

<p>My brain works pretty much like JavaScript, with asynchronous callbacks about totally unrelated thoughts.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>
