So... need to upload pictures, but in the last week I got the desktop machine up and running based on the standard minimal arch install.

I am running Slim as my login control, openbox as my window manager, lxpanel as a panel, which I quite like because it gives me icons for all virtual desktops, and provides a tray area. 

Spudcloud allows me to connect to Slack, Atom has been setup just as I had it before, with unity and molokai themes.

Speaking of themes, I managed to get powerline up and running on my prompt and also in my vim status bar. 

This morning got sopcast and acestream running. Both are soooo much better than when I used them ages ago. 

BTW, very surprised how good the opensource drivers for my 7970 are. So much better than the proprietary ones. Im calling this one a win. 

Will post pictures soon.
