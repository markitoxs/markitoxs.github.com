The PSU for my new machine has arrived, and it is an absolute beauty

I had absolutely no clue that modular power supplies were a thing. This probably tells you how long it has been since I last build a machine. 

The pi2, as much as I love the idea, was a no go for my needs. The web has turned into a jungle where a strong processor is required, so why not? Lets get a cheap PC, and go with it. This does not mean I will not continue my pursuit of a cheap low power machine, but will probably delay the answer to my questions, if any. 

When it comes to computer cases, they all seem pretty standard. Square boxes. Really, there is not much else asides from that. A very long time ago, I came across some hackintosh computer that was using the bitfenix case, and instantly fell in love with it. I quickly added it to my amazon shopping cart, this was probably lik 16/18 months ago? Until last week, when I finally ordered it. 

It arrived last friday. And it turns out that whoever decided the names for the sizes of motherboards was an absolute idiot. To me, as an engineer, it makes virtually, and I have a pretty good imagination, no sense that Micro ITX would be bigger than MINI-ITX, but that is the case. Get it? That is the case.

So I had to go and return to amazon the one I ordered and locate a model compatible with Micro-ITX. Luckily I was able to, but that is a story on its own. 

Currently copying the img of archlinux into the usb stick! Will report back.
