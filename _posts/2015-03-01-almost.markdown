Pain is almost gone. Thats good. Waiting for results. 

There's been minimal surf lately, but I've tried to make the best out of it. Having a calendar and crossing days off it doesnt make sense. It's not about that really. 

I was in SanFrancisco and didnt really like it. Felt alienated. I love the pace of life here even if it might seem boring for some people. I can see the ocean every day, and walk alongside the cliffs. Things are starting to fall into place slowly. 

We danced while we were cooking dinner. 

I just received some rechargeable patteries, they are the eneloop series. Should be good and much better than this energizer rubbish. 

Will I be able to be number 8 in the team? Who knows, hopefully I will. Im debating wether to get 14 or 5 as a backup number, perhaps 6. 

Also, I've come to realize that I no longer care about flagship phones. Sure, they are nice to look at, and perhaps to play with. But there is no point. I think something along the lines of what Motorola is doing with its MotoG and E is much much more interesting in today's world. Trying to provide a good product at a lower cost is very exciting, and I am surprised more companies don't attempt what Motorola (or Lenovo) is doing. 

Will keep updating. Session timeout.
