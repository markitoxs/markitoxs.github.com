Today was an interesting day. To be more precise, the last 24 hours were, since it all started last night. 

Perhaps it would be fair to say that in fact it all started a few weeks ago when I started to realize how clueless I have been about everything, and howit is time to finally jump on the ship that will guide me towards the final destination: becoming the ultimate. 

Not only orchestration is something that I will need to solve, and figure out the best approach, but monitoring will become a big part of it. There doesnt seem to be that many solutions out there. To be fair, I should say FREE solutions. My guess is that companies quickly realized how big of a market this can be in the world we live in, where continuous deployment is no longer a paradime that exists only in the wettest dreams of some crazy hipster guy. 

This is a reality, and it is time to get real. 

Get real. 

I will follow the trends, and best-practices will be there for a reason, without sacrificing the power of one's mind. Do not think inside the box, do not think outside the box. Just think. That is my advise to you future-self. 

The concept of merge has always been interesting to me. Now I have something new to think about. Does rebase currently make sense in our workflow? I believe so. Time to fight for it. 

We will integrate, we will deploy.
