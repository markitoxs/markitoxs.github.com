My setup
========

I cannot even remember the first time I had a server at home. I believe it was during the first year at the University of Edinburgh, maybe ?

I remember the hardware though, it was my old Hewlett-Packard Bell laptop. Which oddly enough, I still have around to this day.

Alright, my current hardware:


- Raspberry pi 2
- Desktop PC with dual monitors
- Nvidia shield TV connected to the TV
- Steam Link connected to the tv

Rasperry pi: The brains
======

```

This is powered via my old nexus 4 usb charger, and has a hard drive directly connected to it via usb

```
[root@montecarlo ~]# lsusb

```
This HDD is a carryover from my life in the uk therefore it has a powerbrick with UK plug, so I have a travel adaptor connected to it. This irritates me greatly and cannot wait to get rid of it.

The raspberry pi is connected directly to my router via a short cat5 cable. Absolute standard Arch install, and no modifications to pacman whatsoever.

List of installed packages: [Packages](https://gist.github.com/markitoxs/a2c6941b3a05eedab22698891df11bd1)

Probably the only ones worth noticing are **rtorrent**,**samba**, **screen**, **sickrage2-git** (this one installed from the AUR).

The raspberry pi acts as a file server, sharing the hard drive contents ( Yes, I am aware of the public, and 0777 mask):

```
[root@montecarlo ~]# cat /etc/samba/smb.conf
[global]
workgroup = WORKGROUP
server string = %h
security = user
usershare allow guests = yes
map to guest = Bad User
[Tera]
path = /mnt/tera
read only = no
public = yes
writable = yes
create mask = 0777
guest ok = yes
browsable = yes
```

Drive which is mounted automatically to `/mnt/tera`

```
[root@montecarlo ~]# cat /etc/fstab
#
# /etc/fstab: static file system information
#
# <file system>	<dir>	<type>	<options>	<dump>	<pass>
/dev/mmcblk0p1  /boot   vfat    defaults        0       0
UUID=29848b2b-9690-4961-8cba-929a734fe181 /mnt/tera ext4 rw,relatime,discard,data=ordered 0 0
```

rTorrent (0.9.6)
---
Alright, here is my `.rtorrent.rc`

```
[root@montecarlo ~]# cat .rtorrent.rc
max_peers_seed = 5000
max_uploads = 30
upload_rate = 10

# Enable the default ratio group.
ratio.enable=

# Change the limits, the defaults should be sufficient.
ratio.min.set=5
ratio.max.set=10
ratio.upload.set=20M

# Changing the command triggered when the ratio is reached.
system.method.set = group.seeding.ratio.command, d.close=, d.erase=

# enable dht
dht = on

# UDP port to use for DHT.
#
dht_port = 12300

# Set whetever the client should try to connect to UDP trackers.
use_udp_trackers = yes

# Start opening ports at a random position within the port range.
port_random = yes

# Where do you want your downloads to go?
directory = /mnt/tera/downloads/
system.umask.set = 0000

# You can put this anywhere you like, but I put it here.
# Remember that you'll have to create this directory
session = ~/.rtorrent/session

# Port range to use for listening.
# Remember if you're connected through a NAT router, you'll
# need to forward these ports.
port_range = 50471-50479
port_random = yes

# Enable peer exchange (for torrents not marked private)
peer_exchange = yes

#encription
encryption=allow_incoming,try_outgoing,enable_retry

scgi_port = :5000
log.xmlrpc  = /tmp/log/xmlrpc.log

log.open_file = "rtorrent.log", (cat,/tmp/rtorrent.log)  
log.open_file = "tracker.log", (cat,/tmp/tracker.log)  

log.add_output = "info", "rtorrent.log"

log.add_output = "dht_debug", "tracker.log"
log.add_output = "tracker_debug", "tracker.log"


#TVSHOWS LABEL
# Add new method to get finished dir
system.method.insert = d.get_finished_dir,simple,"cat=/mnt/tera/complete/,$d.get_custom1="

system.method.set_key = event.download.finished,move_complete,"d.set_directory=$d.get_finished_dir=;execute=mkdir,-p,$d.get_finished_dir=;execute=mv,-u,$d.get_base_path=,$d.get_finished_dir="
```

The important things to note are:

  - enabling scgi + log file  
    ```
    scgi_port = :5000
    log.xmlrpc  = /tmp/log/xmlrpc.log
    ```
  - The move of stuff into a complete folder:  
    ```
    #TVSHOWS LABEL
    # Add new method to get finished dir
    system.method.insert = d.get_finished_dir,simple,"cat=/mnt/tera/complete/,$d.get_custom1="
    ```
  - The usage of that move method:  
    ```
    system.method.set_key = event.download.finished,move_complete,"d.set_directory=$d.get_finished_dir=;execute=mkdir,-p,$d.get_finished_dir=;execute=mv,-u,$d.get_base_path=,$d.get_finished_dir="
    ```  
<br />

Then go ahead and create a systemd unit file to start rTorrent on boot:

```
[root@montecarlo ~]# cat /etc/systemd/system/default.target.wants/rt.service
[Unit]
Description=rTorrent
After=network.target

[Service]
User=root
Type=forking
KillMode=none
ExecStart=/usr/bin/screen -d -m -fa -S rtorrent /usr/bin/rtorrent
ExecStop=/usr/bin/killall -w -s 2 /usr/bin/rtorrent
WorkingDirectory=%h
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

And enable it with: `systemctl enable rt`

SickRage
---

Sickrage is my download manager choice. I am calling it a download manager becuase I am not sure what to call it. It basically keeps a database with the shows we follow and looks for the episodes as they come out. I installed the package off the AUR: `yaourt sickrage2-git` which allows you to start it off via a systemd unit:  
```
[root@montecarlo ~]# systemctl list-units | grep sickrage  
sickrage.service                  loaded active running   SickRage Daemon
```

Here comes the complicated part, so please stay with me on this one.

Go to general config and:

  - The root directory for sickrage will be at `/mnt/tera/Video/tvshows`
  - Generate an API key (for use later)

Go to Search Settings / Torrent search:

  - Enable torrent search providers
  - Send .rtorrent files to: `rTorrent`
  - Torrent host:port    `scgi://localhost:5000`
  - Http Authentication:  `None`
  - Add label to torrent: `tvshows`
  - Downloaded files location: `/mnt/tera/complete`

  (Note that the scgi details and the location matches with our previous rtorrent config.)

  You can verify the scgi connection by hitting ** Test Connection**


Go to Post Processing:

  - Enable
  - Post Processing Dir: `/mnt/tera/complete/tvshows`
  - Processing Method: `Symbolic Link`

  I choose Symbolic link to prevent issues with rtorrent seeding. Sickrage might move the file before the upload ratio is met, and leave you with an orphaned file.

Go to Notifications:

  - Enable notifying kodi (you will need to setup kodi to allow remote calls)

Got to Shows/Add Shows/Add New Show

 - Find the show
 - Select Parent folder as: `/mnt/tera/Videos/tvshows`  
<br />

Dont forget to enable the service with: `systemctl enable sickrage`

Nvidia Shield TV
==========

What a wonderful piece of hardware this is. All I did was simply isntall Kodi on it, and add `/mnt/tera/Videos/tvshows` as a share with the type of content set to Tvshows.
