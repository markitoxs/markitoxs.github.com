My chest still hurts. I have no clue whats going.

Just cut my hair. I need to stop doing this by myself. 

Dang it still hurts. 

Creativity. 

Writing. 

Reading. 

Surfing. 

Longerboard. Paddle power. 

Snowboarding next week should be fun. 

I wish I had a normal machine that I could run linux on it and not have to worry about stupid things like battery life. Perhaps the raspberry pi2 that I just got might be the answer? It might be powerful enough, although it would be awesome to just get a NUC. Could I justify spending that much money for one? They are a bit pricey. 

Also, it worries me that a new generation of NUCs comes out after I buy this one, would be like a terrible waste of money. 

I really want a coffee with whipped cream and a donut, oh man, that sounds so good. Fuck it, maybe I just get one tomorrow. Why not. 

Got two Sonos Play:1 and they are absolutely fantastic, came across someone on reddit who said they shouldnt have tried the stereo setup, because now they want to buy two more. I am in exactly the same situation. 

Joan asked me what was a simple question today, about some script, and I failed to deliver an answer that was satisfactory. That bugs me a lot, and I want to know the answer. 

My brain works pretty much like JavaScript, with asynchronous callbacks about totally unrelated thoughts. 

Peace.
